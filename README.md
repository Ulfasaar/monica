Monica is a useful digital assistant that specializes in helping developers.

**This is in a super alpha state so don't rely on it for anything :)**

Currently it only supports Linux and my machines setup, eventually it will support others and be more configurable.


templates for now have a [tmp] appended to the end of the file extension

this is to avoid any conflicts or confusion with files that might use the word tmp or template in its file name

Template syntax for now is just 
${variable_name} where each instance of said variable 
will contain the same data. 

In future it will probably swap to Haxe's own templating system
